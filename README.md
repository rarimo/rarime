# @rarimo-snap-monorepo

This repository demonstrates how to develop a snap with TypeScript. For detailed instructions, see [the MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html#serving-a-snap-to-your-local-environment).

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that can customize the wallet experience.

## Snaps is pre-release software

To interact with (your) Snaps, you will need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), a canary distribution for developers that provides access to upcoming features.

## Getting Started

Clone the metamask-snap repository:

```shell
yarn install && yarn start
```

## Contributing

### Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and fix any automatically fixable issues.
## Notes

- Babel is used for transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript, so when building with the CLI,
  `transpilationMode` must be set to `localOnly` (default) or `localAndDeps`.
