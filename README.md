```shell
yarn install && yarn start
```

### Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and fix any automatically fixable issues.

  `transpilationMode` must be set to `localOnly` (default) or `localAndDeps`.
